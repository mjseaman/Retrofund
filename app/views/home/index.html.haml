        About us
      %p.lead Retrofund came into being at a Hack City hackathon, a 24-hour codefest that turned into a 24/7 sprint to build out the platform we have today.  Our founders, Addison Huddy, Tomas Janusas, Tim Quijano and Mitch Seaman, care deeply about reducing our impact on the environment.  Our goal is to shrink carbon footprints and energy bills workdwide, one retrofit at a time.
